# 🛟 OHB — Open HamClock Backend

When the original backend went dark, the clocks didn’t have to.

Open-source, self-hostable backend replacement for HamClock — restoring live propagation data, maps, and feeds.

What's a backend? It is how HamClock got all of its data. Without a separate backend, all HamClock's will cease to function by June 2026.

Drop-in compatible with existing HamClock's — no firmware changes required.

OHB provides faithful replacements for the data feeds and map assets
that HamClock depends on — built by operators, for operators.

## ✨ What OHB Does

- Rebuilds HamClock dynamic text feeds (solar, geomag, DRAP, PSK, RBN, WSPR, Amateur Satellites, DxNews, Contests, etc)
- Generates map overlays (MUF-RT, DRAP, Aurora, Wx-mB, etc.)
- Produces zlib-compressed BMP assets in multiple resolutions
- Designed for Raspberry Pi, cloud, or on-prem deployment
- Fully open source and community maintained
