# 🛟 OHB — Open HamClock Backend

When the original backend went dark, the clocks didn’t have to.

Open-source, self-hostable backend replacement for HamClock — restoring live propagation data, maps, and feeds.

What's a backend? It is how HamClock got all of its data. Without a separate backend, all HamClock's will cease to function by June 2026.

Drop-in compatible with existing HamClock's — no firmware changes required.

OHB provides faithful replacements for the data feeds and map assets
that HamClock depends on — built by operators, for operators.

## ✨ What OHB Does

- Rebuilds HamClock dynamic text feeds (solar, geomag, DRAP, PSK, RBN, WSPR, Amateur Satellites, DxNews, Contests, etc)
- Generates map overlays (MUF-RT, DRAP, Aurora, Wx-mB, etc.)
- Produces zlib-compressed BMP assets in multiple resolutions
- Designed for Raspberry Pi, cloud, or on-prem deployment
- Fully open source and community maintained
- Auto log rotation
- Command and Control Dashboard (future)
- Runs in Raspberry Pi 4, 5, PC, Virtual Machine, Bare Metal or Cloud
  
## OHB Central Server (testing)
These steps let you point a HamClock (or any client) at a shared OHB test server without self-hosting. This is a local-only change on your machine and is easy to revert.

This is a test server and may be subject to unannounced or unplanned updates. 

Important: Editing your hosts file overrides normal DNS for the specified hostname. After this change, anything on this computer that connects to clearskyinstitute.com will go to the OHB test server instead.

### /etc/hosts file modification
The original vision of OHB was to use a 'DNS sinkhole' concept. This will tell your system to not use clearskyinstitute.com if you do not use the -b option for local install. For now, **do not** use this option if you are self-hosting. This is a semi-permanent change.

```sudo nano /etc/hosts```

Add this line:

```44.32.64.64     clearskyinstitute.com```

Save the file with CTRL+X

Next, verify it is in effect

```getent hosts clearskyinstitute.com```

It should return

```44.32.64.64     clearskyinstitute.com```

Finally, you should be able to ping the re-directed host

```ping -c 5 clearskyinstitute.com```

It should say 100% and you should be able to restart your hamclock to connect to ohb.hamclock.app.

### -b option

HamClock version 4.22 has been tested with the -b option. You can connect without modifying your /etc/hosts file. This will allow you to switch between different backends and is the easiest option for most people. 

In the directory where hamclock is installed, 

```./hamclock -b ohb.hamclock.app:80```

If unsure, you can type

``which hamclock``

and if hamclock is installed in your PATH on the system then it will tell you where the application is installed. From there, you can type the path to hamclock

``/path/to/hamclock -b ohb.hamclock.app:80``

/path/to/hamclock may vary on your system
