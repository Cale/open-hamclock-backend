## Project Completion Status

Each supporting file type has a data generation script. These scripts operate on a schedule that is defined in a [crontab](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/scripts/crontab). The crontab has been specifically tuned to match as close as possible the original ClearSkyInstitute data generation times and be friendly to CPU/MEM on the host. 

### Dynamic Text Files
These are replaced dynamically in the background on the target host per the baselined [crontab](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/scripts/crontab).

### Dynamic Map Files
Note: Anything under maps/ is considered a "Core Map" in HamClock

These are replaced dynamically in the background on the target host per the baselined [crontab](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/scripts/crontab).

- [x] [maps/Clouds*](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/scripts/update_cloud_maps.sh)
- [x] maps/Countries* - reuse from CSI; no need to regenerate
- [x] [maps/Wx-mB*](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/scripts/update_wx_mb_maps.sh)
- [x] [maps/Wx-in*](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/scripts/update_wx_mb_maps.sh)
- [x] [maps/Aurora](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/scripts/update_aurora_maps.sh)
- [x] [maps/DRAP*](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/scripts/update_drap_maps.sh)
- [x] [maps/MUF-RT*](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/scripts/kc2g_muf_heatmap.sh)
- [x] maps/Terrain* - reuse from CSI; no need to regenerate
- [x] [SDO/*](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/scripts/update_all_sdo.sh)

### Dynamic Web Endpoints
These are endpoints that dynamically return data based on query parameters to the Perl scripts. Query parameters can be 0..Many.

- [x] [ham/HamClock/RSS/web15rss.pl](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/ham/HamClock/RSS/web15rss.pl) and this [job](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/scripts/web15rss_fetch.py) makes the file
- [x] [ham/HamClock/version.pl](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/ham/HamClock/version.pl)
- [x] [ham/HamClock/wx.pl](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/ham/HamClock/wx.pl)
- [x] [ham/HamClock/fetchIPGeoloc.pl](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/ham/HamClock/fetchIPGeoloc.pl) - requires free tier 1000 req per day account and API key
- [ ] ham/HamClock/fetchBandConditions.pl - implemented however bypassed via proxied
- [ ] ham/HamClock/fetchVOACAPArea.pl - proxied by CSI until we can work out complex task
- [ ] ham/HamClock/fetchVOACAP-MUF.pl - proxied by CSI until we can work out complex task
- [ ] ham/HamClock/fetchVOACAP-TOA.pl - proxied by CSI until we can work out complex task
- [ ] [ham/HamClock/fetchPSKReporter.pl](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/ham/HamClock/fetchPSKReporter.pl) - currently proxied, it is implemented however it will be subject to rate limiting if deployed centrally. I have created a PSK Reporter proxy as of last week (https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/ohb-pskreporter-proxy) and this requires careful integration testing to ensure it works before I am willing to release it into production
- [x] [ham/HamClock/fetchWSPR.pl](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/ham/HamClock/fetchWSPR.pl)
- [x] [ham/HamClock/fetchRBN.pl](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/ham/HamClock/fetchRBN.pl)

### Static Files
These files never change or are unlikely to need change any time soon.
- [x] [ham/HamClock/cities2.txt](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/blob/main/ham/HamClock/cities2.txt) - we did not update this file as it appears to require no change
